# puppet-mosquitto 
<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lowi-yeah/puppet-mpsquitto.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lowi-yeah/puppet-mpsquitto) -->

[Wirbelsturm](https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm)-compatible [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) module to deploy
[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1 broker.

You can use this Puppet module to deploy Mosquitto to physical and virtual machines, for instance via your existing
internal or cloud-based Puppet infrastructure and via a tool such as [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) for local
and remote deployments.

# Quick start

See section [Usage](#usage) below.


<a name="features"></a>

# Features

* Supports Mosquitto 1.4.8+, i.e. the latest stable release version.
* Decouples code (Puppet manifests) from configuration data ([Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/)) through the
  use of Puppet parameterized classes, i.e. class parameters.  Hence you should use Hiera to control how Kafka is
  deployed and to which machines.
* Supports RHEL OS family (e.g. RHEL 6, CentOS 6, Amazon Linux).
    * Code contributions to support additional OS families are welcome!
* Supports tuning of system-level configuration such as the maximum number of open files (cf.
  `/etc/security/limits.conf`) to optimize the performance of your Mosquitto deployments.
* Mosquitto is run under process supervision via [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) version 3.0+.


<a name="requirements"></a>

# Requirements and assumptions

* This module requires that the target machines to which you are deploying Mosquitto have **yum repositories configured**
  for pulling the Mosquitto package (i.e. RPM).
    * Because we run Mosquitto via supervisord through [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor), the
      supervisord RPM must be available, too.  See [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor)
      for details.
* This module requires the following **additional Puppet modules**:

    * [puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib)
    * [puppet-limits](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-limits)
    * [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor)

  It is recommended that you add these modules to your Puppet setup via
  [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet).  See the `Puppetfile` snippet in section
  _Installation_ below for a starting example.
* **When using Vagrant**: Depending on your Vagrant box (image) you may need to manually configure/disable firewall
  settings -- otherwise machines may not be able to talk to each other.  One option to manage firewall settings is via
  [puppetlabs-firewall](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall).


<a name="installation"></a>

# Installation

It is recommended to use [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) to add this module to your
Puppet setup.

Add the following lines to your `Puppetfile`:

```
# Add the stdlib dependency as hosted on public Puppet Forge.
#
# We intentionally do not include the stdlib dependency in our Modulefile to make it easier for users who decided to
# use internal copies of stdlib so that their deployments are not coupled to the availability of PuppetForge.  While
# there are tools such as puppet-library for hosting internal forges or for proxying to the public forge, not everyone
# is actually using those tools.
mod 'puppetlabs/stdlib', '>= 4.1.0'

# Add the puppet-kafka module
mod 'mosquitto',
  :git => 'https://github.com/lowi-yeah/puppet-mosquitto.git'

# Add the puppet-limits and puppet-supervisor module dependencies
mod 'limits',
  :git => 'https://github.com/miguno/puppet-limits.git'

mod 'supervisor',
  :git => 'https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor.git'
```

Then use librarian-puppet to install (or update) the Puppet modules.


<a name="configuration"></a>

# Configuration

* See [init.pp](manifests/init.pp) and [broker.pp](manifests/broker.pp) for the list of currently supported
  configuration parameters.  These should be self-explanatory.
* See [params.pp](manifests/params.pp) for the default values of those configuration parameters.

Of special note is the class parameter `$config_map`:  You can use this parameter to "inject" arbitrary Kafka config
settings via Hiera/YAML into the Kafka broker configuration file (default name: `server.properties`).  However you
should not re-define config settings via `$config_map` that already have explicit Puppet class parameters (such as
`$broker_id`).  See the examples below for more information on `$config_map` usage.


<a name="usage"></a>

# Usage

**IMPORTANT: Make sure you read and follow the [Requirements and assumptions](#requirements) section above.**
**Otherwise the examples below will of course not work.**


<a name="configuration-examples"></a>

## Configuration examples


<a name="hiera"></a>

### Using Hiera


A "full" single-node example that includes the deployment of [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) via
[puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor) and
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) via [puppet-zookeeper](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-zookeeper).
Here, both ZooKeeper and Kafka are running on the same machine.  The Kafka broker will listen on port `9092/tcp` and
will connect to the ZooKeeper server running at `localhost:2181`.  That's a nice setup for your local development
laptop or CI server, for instance.


```yaml
---
classes:
  - kafka::service
  - supervisor
  - zookeeper::service
```

A more sophisticated example that overrides some of the default settings and also demonstrates the use of `$config_map`.
In this example, the broker connects to the ZooKeeper server `zookeeper1`.
Take a look at [Kafka's Java/JVM configuration notes](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#java) as well as
recommended [production configurations](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#prodconfig).

```yaml
---
classes:
  - kafka::service
  - supervisor

## Kafka
kafka::broker_id: 0
kafka::config_map:
  log.roll.hours: 48
  log.retention.hours: 48
kafka::kafka_heap_opts: '-Xms2G -Xmx2G -XX:NewSize=256m -XX:MaxNewSize=256m'
kafka::kafka_opts: '-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=70 -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution'
kafka::zookeeper_connect:
  - 'zookeeper1:2181'

# Optional: Manage /etc/security/limits.conf to tune the maximum number
# of open files, which is a typical setting you must change for Kafka
# production environments.  Default: false (do not manage)
kafka::limits_manage: true
kafka::limits_nofile: 65536
```


<a name="manifests"></a>

### Using Puppet manifests

_Note: It is recommended to use Hiera to control deployments instead of using this module in your Puppet manifests_
_directly._

TBD


<a name="service-management"></a>

## Service management

To manually start, stop, restart, or check the status of the Kafka broker service, respectively:

    $ sudo supervisorctl [start|stop|restart|status] kafka-broker

Example:

    $ sudo supervisorctl status
    kafka-broker                          RUNNING    pid 16461, uptime 3 days, 09:22:38


<a name="log-files"></a>

## Log files

_Note: The locations below may be different depending on the Kafka RPM you are actually using._

* Kafka log files: `/var/log/kafka/*.log`
* Supervisord log files related to Kafka processes:
    * `/var/log/supervisor/kafka-broker/kafka-broker.out`
    * `/var/log/supervisor/kafka-broker/kafka-broker.err`
* Supervisord main log file: `/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log`


<a name="custom-zk-root"></a>

# Custom ZooKeeper chroot (experimental)

Kafka supports custom ZooKeeper chroots, which is useful for multi-tenant ZooKeeper setups.
This Puppet module has experimental support for this feature.


## Creating the chroot

If Kafka will share a ZooKeeper cluster with other users, you might want to create a znode in ZooKeeper in which to
store the data of your Kafka cluster.

First, you must create the znode manually yourself.  You can use `zkCli.sh` that ships with ZooKeeper, or you can use
the Kafka built-in `zookeeper-shell`.  The following example creates the znode `/my_kafka`.

```bash
$ kafka zookeeper-shell <zookeeper_host>:2182
Connecting to kraken-zookeeper
Welcome to ZooKeeper!
JLine support is enabled

WATCHER::

WatchedEvent state:SyncConnected type:None path:null
[zk: kraken-zookeeper(CONNECTED) 0] create /my_kafka kafka
Created /my_kafka
```

You can use whatever chroot znode path you like.  The second argument (```data```) is arbitrary.  In this example we
used 'kafka'.


## Configuring Kafka to use the ZooKeeper chroot

When configuring the ZooKeeper connection string you must only add the custom chroot _to the last entry_ in the
`zookeeper_connect` array.

```yaml
# Irrelevant config settings have been omitted/snipped
kafka::brokers:
  broker1:
    # WRONG!
    #
    # This Hiera configuration is the same as if you had added the following (incorrect) setting
    # to the normal Kafka configuration file `config/server.properties`:
    #
    #    zookeeper.connect=zkserver1:2181/my_kafka,zkserver2:2181/my_kafka
    #
    zookeeper_connect:
      - 'zkserver1:2181/my_kafka'
      - 'zkserver2:2181/my_kafka'

    # CORRECT
    #
    # This Hiera configuration is the same as if you had added the following (correct) setting
    # to the normal Kafka configuration file `config/server.properties`:
    #
    #    zookeeper.connect=zkserver1:2181,zkserver2:2181/my_kafka
    #
    zookeeper_connect:
      - 'zkserver1:2181'
      - 'zkserver2:2181/my_kafka'
```


<a name="development"></a>

# Development

It is recommended run the `bootstrap` script after a fresh checkout:

    $ ./bootstrap

You have access to a bunch of rake commands to help you with module development and testing:

    $ bundle exec rake -T
    rake acceptance          # Run acceptance tests
    rake build               # Build puppet module package
    rake clean               # Clean a built module package
    rake coverage            # Generate code coverage information
    rake help                # Display the list of available rake tasks
    rake lint                # Check puppet manifests with puppet-lint / Run puppet-lint
    rake module:bump         # Bump module version to the next minor
    rake module:bump_commit  # Bump version and git commit
    rake module:clean        # Runs clean again
    rake module:push         # Push module to the Puppet Forge
    rake module:release      # Release the Puppet module, doing a clean, build, tag, push, bump_commit and git push
    rake module:tag          # Git tag with the current module version
    rake spec                # Run spec tests in a clean fixtures directory
    rake spec_clean          # Clean up the fixtures directory
    rake spec_prep           # Create the fixtures directory
    rake spec_standalone     # Run spec tests on an existing fixtures directory
    rake syntax              # Syntax check Puppet manifests and templates
    rake syntax:hiera        # Syntax check Hiera config files
    rake syntax:manifests    # Syntax check Puppet manifests
    rake syntax:templates    # Syntax check Puppet templates
    rake test                # Run syntax, lint, and spec tests

Of particular interest are:

* `rake test` -- run syntax, lint, and spec tests
* `rake syntax` -- to check you have valid Puppet and Ruby ERB syntax
* `rake lint` -- checks against the [Puppet Style Guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html)
* `rake spec` -- run unit tests


<a name="todo"></a>

# TODO

* Enhance in-line documentation of Puppet manifests.
* Add more unit tests and specs.
* Add rollback/remove functionality to completely purge Kafka related packages and configuration files from a machine.
